# Geetest Captcha for React

I recently discovered [Geetest Captcha](https://www.geetest.com/en/), which I saw while logging in to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en). It's a cool way to captcha test.

While developing, I didn't find any useful package in NPM. I tried two packages which are in the `package.json` file.

Later I read their [docs for the web](https://docs.geetest.com/BehaviorVerification/deploy/client/web) and implemented it inside the `useEffect` hook.

If you've worked with it on Reactjs, please let me know if you have got a better way of implementing it. I'm available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tutuldevs).
